This project contains a series of quick and dirty mockups to show ideas for new
workflows in Orion.

Right now it's a combination of screenshots from existing implementations and 
cut/paste mockups.  It's not yet obvious what's clickable in each mockup. We're
trying to annotate and bold the clickable parts so that they stand out a bit...

The index.html page shows an orion home page when you have no content defined yet.  
(You are a new user.) There is a link from that page to show you what you'd see
if you logged in and had already been working with content.

From there follow the arrows and bubbles to see what's clickable.  Once you're in a 
navigator...
-  click on "org.eclipse.orion.client" to go to a repository mockup
-  then click on Git Log to see a log mockup
-  click on the annotated commit link to see the commit page.
