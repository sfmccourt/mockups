This project contains a series of quick and dirty mockups to show ideas for new
workflows in Orion.

Right now it's a combination of screenshots from existing implementations and 
cut/paste mockups.  It's not yet obvious what's clickable in each mockup. We're
trying to annotate and bold the clickable parts so that they stand out a bit...

To follow the mockup:
-  click on the "navigator" links from index.html to go to a nav mockup
-  click on "org.eclipse.orion.client" to go to the repository mockup
-  then click on Git Log to see a log
-  click on the annotated commit link to see the commit page.
